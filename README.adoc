:icons: font

Find duplicate files. The duplicates are found by comparing SHA-512 hashsums. Right now the app uses a postgresql database.

.TODO
* __Make the app use a plaintext configuration file__
** __specify default fileroot to search from__
** what kind of files should be compared (images, video, text..., all)
** __DB user settings__
** __should the app search for new files, or just continue to hash unhashed files from the db__
** __maybe some kind of wizard to create the config file__
* Copy all unique files into a folder
** choose different naming schemes.
* Add the ability to compare files from different computers.
** copy unique files to a folder on a different computer (using SSH2)
